FA_RaidTools
============

INSTALL: Put the folder named "FARaidTools" (NOT FARaidTools-master) into the Interface/Addons/ folder in your WoW install.

TODO:
- Add spec/class based gear filters on what shows up in the window
- Add a button that automates taking tells on an item. A fixed timer along with a addon command could be used so that others using the addon could see the progress of the item. Also potentially add a way for people to "stall" the timer of an item by request.
- Retroactively pull item values from aspects chat and pass them to others in the raid.
- Add the amount of DKP spent on the item to the LootAlert frame.
- Bug: If you link a ton of items in one message and then send it it ends an item somehow.
- Change text on mode button to be more clear.
- Shift click to link items, Ctrl click to view items.
- Bug: Pressing enter doesn't submit the bid amount form.
